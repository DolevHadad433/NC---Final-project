MyTrainingManager is an app that is built for managing workouts for gymnasts. 
The app allows for the gymnasts to register to the service and login after that whenever they like, choose when they want to train, the type of the workout and also choose the trainer they want to work with. 
The app also allows the admin to manage the users, the workouts and the trainers.
